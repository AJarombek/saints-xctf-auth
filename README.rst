================

Lambda functions used for authentication in the SaintsXCTF application.  Some of these AWS Lambda functions are part of
the ``auth.saintsxctf.com`` domain (which is located behind API Gateway).  Others are standalone, used for purposes like
AWS Secrets Manager secret rotation or API Gateway lambda authorizers.
